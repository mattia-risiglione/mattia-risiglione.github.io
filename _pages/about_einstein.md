I am a researcher at the [Dynamic Legged Systems Lab](https://dls.iit.it/). Previously, I received my master's degree from ETH Zurich, where I was advised by Professor [Marco Hutter](https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=DO3quJYAAAAJ&hl=en).  

I am interested in building intelligent robot agents that can perform useful tasks in diverse real world settings. My research intersects model-based and data-driven techniques for teaching robots new skills. 


#Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture #in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

#Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property #of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/#publications/) automatically.

#Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons]#(https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable #all of them.
