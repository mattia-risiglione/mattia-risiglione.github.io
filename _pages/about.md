I am a researcher at the Dynamic Legged Systems Lab at the Italian Institute of Technology. Previously, I received my master's degree from ETH Zurich, where I was advised by Professor [Marco Hutter](https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=DO3quJYAAAAJ&hl=en).  

I am interested in building intelligent robot agents that can perform useful tasks in diverse real world settings. My research intersects model-based and data-driven techniques for robots acquiring new skills.
